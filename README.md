# React Create Component

What
A global cli tool for creating modular react components. Inspired by ng-generate for Angluar. 

Why
Creating modular react components requires a lot of boilerplate code. This tool looks to create that boilerplate rapidly and allow the developer to focus on what matters, writting component logic!

Where
Currently the tool assumes you store your components at `./src/ui`

How
Install 
`$npm i -g moaiii-react-create-component`

Once installed globally you have access to the CLI command `$rcr`. 

An example command would be
`$rcr --view --WTF --stateful --redux`
